My name is Marco Caballero and I'm a Ph.D. student at University of Cambridge, in the [Systems Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/). This blog is an outlet for me to share information about my interests in the Tech industry and academia, as well as my opinion on such subjects.

### More Information

I have about 10 years of experience in the industry as a Software Engineer in companies like Microsoft and Oracle. My favorite programming languages are C, Python, Java, and Rust.

Currently as a Ph.D. student, my interests are around subjects such as distributed systems, decentralization, high performance computing, mesh networks, security and privacy in the systems context.
